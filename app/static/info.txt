Reference Checker: A program to help academic paper review. The goal of this project is to take some of the hassle out of reviewing academic papers by providing an analysis of the sentences citing sources. In my experience with the program, the sentences that are verified with a ‘yes’ or ‘maybe’ are generally correct. Sentences with a ‘no’ verdict need further review and can sometimes yield interesting findings. 
The arbitration process is obviously made possible with the available API from various models. The challenge was finding a cost efficient yet effective model with a large enough context window. 
Over the past year, there has been a great deal of progress on this front both in terms of context window and cost. The program now generally works and produces useful output. It can be even better if you are willing to dish out about $1 per article with more expensive models and that may be necessary for a more advanced version, but for now, as a proof of concept, the current, lower cost model, seems to work.
